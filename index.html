        <p> All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</p>
        <p>
            In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.
            </p>
            <h3>What is HTML? </h3>
            <p> HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).</p>

               <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p> 
                
                In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
                <ol>
<li>The opening tag</li>
<li> The opening tag</li>
<li>The actual element</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Why should you learn HTML?</h2>
                <p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:</p>
                <li>o be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
                <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
